# Neokey
Using Adafruit's Neokey to quickly change file names in order to sort them the way you want.
First you need to open you file explorer and navigate to a folder where you want to manually change the order of the files in it.
Touch and maintain the touchpad to activate listening mode, press the key once or several times to trigger different actions then release the touchpad to validate.

ITERATE --> :
- One press to rename the selected file and add "001" (incrementing on each file) so you can manually choose an order of files.
- 2 presses and it remove the added increment. Pay attention to what is currently selected)...
- 4 presses to close the window (ALT+F4).

COUNTER -->  :
- Maintain touch than click any times you want to increase the counter.
- When you'll let go of the touchpad, the selected file on you explorer / finder will be renamed to start with "(the number of times you clicked)X_".
- If you click the button without maintaining the touchpad,  the device will just erase the 3 first characters of the selected file, pay attention to what is currently selected)...
